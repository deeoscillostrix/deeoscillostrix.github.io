                    Your average, not-so-old, not-so-wise, and inexperienced

                "The stilt-owls (Grallistrix) is an extinct genus of true owls
                which contains four species, all of which lived on the Hawaiian
                Islands." - Wikipedia
              </p>

              <p>
                "How the heck did this one hatch out of nowhere then?", you may
                ask. Also how do stilt owls act? The sheer number of questions
                you can think of really accentuate the long-standing conundrum
                behind how Oscillo initially hatched into existence. "I wish I
                knew," he postulates. "But I really do hope to find out some
                day. For now, I'm just winging it till that happens!"
              </p>

              <p>
                As an oddball amongst the others while growing up, making
                friends was tough for Oscillo. This, along with his upbringing
                has mostly shaped him to prefer to not be in the limelight in
                several situations. Given that he's naturally an introvert,
                however, it more or less worked out in his favor. "I also do end
                up learning to observe from a distance a lot, and it does pay
                off to be eventually heard in the end!"
              </p>

              <p>
                His go-to pastime activities include sudoku puzzles, casual
                video games, web dev, and seeking out relics of his childhood
                nostalgia. As an aspiring educator, he's also passionate about
                education and learning. He strives to give his all to ensure the
                next generations are better than he is. "Being on top isn't
                something that would satisfy me in the long run. It's seeing
                those lives I touch achieve more than I did that would satisfy
                me immensely. I think that's what I hoped my teachers I was
                blessed to have had felt when they taught me."

              <p>
                SnowTrap was adopted from Crazetopher David Blazing III's lawn
                by Oscillo Strix in May 2009. He suddenly gained mobility in May
                2013 overnight - to this day, nobody (not even SnowTrap himself)
                knows how he managed to uproot himself and gain this ability.
              </p>

              <p>
                Like other fellow plants of his species, he hates puns related
                to the cold - "stay frosty", "chill out", you name it. He just
                requires generous amounts of sunlight, high-fiber CO<sub>2</sub>{" "}
                and lots of water to sustain himself in your average non-snowy
                climate. Luckily for him, most regard him as cute for a
                bizarrely sentient species of flora. "I'm perfectly okay with
                that," he assures. As for his fellow junior plants, they regard
                him as a dependable and kind big brother figure to them.
              </p>

              <p>
                Currently, he remains close with his adopter, tending to the
                house garden often and accompanying each other in many, many
                adventures. When asked about his relationship with the odd owl,
                he just shrugged and said, "I'm just besties with him. What more
                were you expecting?"
              </p>

              <p>
                Interestingly for a plant belonging to the Winter-mint family,
                he loves the color orange, hence his snow hat themed after an
                orange lolly. There exist rumors pointing to him having a
                possible connection to the plant renegade hero known as "The
                Tangerine Mist".

                Milo first got her name from Oscillo after he and pal SnowTrap
                found her enjoying a cup of hot chocolate that she made herself
                - from what was available in the kitchen. It was not until the
                three befriended each other when they realized that this
                sweetheart really, really loves anything chocolate.. she's
                mild-tempered and gentle, but we prefer not to find out how to
                cross the line to cross her. Keep your favorite chocolate bars
                and snacks away!
              </p>

              <p>
                It remains unclear when Milo was grown in Crazy Dave's lawn and
                up until she uprooted itself mysteriously like how SnowTrap did
                (this was found to be true upon consulting Crazy Dave); SnowTrap
                has no recollection of meeting her before prior to that first
                sudden encounter. Regardless, they have since formed a strong
                sibling-like relationship with each other, despite having
                opposing natural elements between each other.
              </p>

              <p>
                Like all the other fire peashooters, Milo started off as being a
                normal peashooter. However, she has an inner vitality that
                caused her to combust into her current form. As such, any acts
                of extinguishing her fire does not kill her, and her having that
                inner vitality means she would simply blaze herself back into
                her normal form in a moment's time. "It was amusing to see the
                shock on their faces when they realized they couldn't kill me
                simply with water or fire extinguishers," she says. "Now it's
                just mundane, and more of a nuisance to me. My hair sure doesn't
                appreciate that!"
              </p>

              <p>
                Speaking of her flaming hair, she has amazing fire control,
                being able to burn anyone she chooses to or not, as well as
                being a lethal flamethrower if she chooses to do so. Her hair,
                being made up of flames on her head is skillfully groomed to her
                liking. Unfortunately, she still has tendencies on starting
                small insipid flames around her on non-living things around her
                at times.. the saving grace here is that she's very quick and
                resourceful to settle such incidents. "I have never had a
                history of burning anyone by accident, but if I had five bucks
