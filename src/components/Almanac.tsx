								"The stilt-owls (Grallistrix) is an extinct genus of true owls
								which contains four species, all of which lived on the Hawaiian
								Islands." - Wikipedia
							</p>

							<p>
								"How the heck did this one hatch out of nowhere then?", you may
								ask. Also how do stilt owls act? The sheer number of questions
								you can think of really accentuate the long-standing conundrum
								behind how Oscillo initially hatched into existence. "I wish I
								knew," he postulates. "But I really do hope to find out some
								day. For now, I'm just winging it till that happens!"
							</p>

							<p>
								As an oddball amongst the others while growing up, making
								friends was tough for Oscillo. This, along with his upbringing
								has mostly shaped him to prefer to not be in the limelight in
								several situations. Given that he's naturally an introvert,
								however, it more or less worked out in his favor. "I also do end
								up learning to observe from a distance a lot, and it does pay
								off to be eventually heard in the end!"
							</p>

							<p>
								His go-to pastime activities include sudoku puzzles, casual
								video games, web dev, and seeking out relics of his childhood
								nostalgia. As an aspiring educator, he's also passionate about
								education and learning. He strives to give his all to ensure the
								next generations are better than he is. "Being on top isn't
								something that would satisfy me in the long run. It's seeing
								those lives I touch achieve more than I did that would satisfy
								me immensely. I think that's what I hoped my teachers I was
								blessed to have had felt when they taught me."

								SnowTrap was adopted from Crazetopher David Blazing III's lawn
								by Oscillo Strix in May 2009. He suddenly gained mobility in May
								2013 overnight - to this day, nobody (not even SnowTrap himself)
								knows how he managed to uproot himself and gain this ability.
							</p>

							<p>
								Like other fellow plants of his species, he hates puns related
								to the cold - "stay frosty", "chill out", you name it. He just
								requires generous amounts of sunlight, high-fiber CO<sub>2</sub>{" "}
								and lots of water to sustain himself in your average non-snowy
								climate. Luckily for him, most regard him as cute for a
								bizarrely sentient species of flora. "I'm perfectly okay with
								that," he assures. As for his fellow junior plants, they regard
								him as a dependable and kind big brother figure to them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Currently, he remains close with his adopter, tending to the
								house garden often and accompanying each other in many, many
								adventures. When asked about his relationship with the odd owl,
								he just shrugged and said, "I'm just besties with him. What more
								were you expecting?"
							</p>

							<p>
								Interestingly for a plant belonging to the Winter-mint family,
								he loves the color orange, hence his snow hat themed after an
								orange lolly. There exist rumors pointing to him having a
								possible connection to the plant renegade hero known as "The
								Tangerine Mist".
