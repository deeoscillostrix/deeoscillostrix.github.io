## Extra Notes

### Images

All images are loaded using .webp format to reduce data usage and load durations when loading the website.
Most images displayed have their JPG/JPEG/PNG variants included in the same directory.
If you wish to download them, just replace the extension in the URL bar in your browser to obtain them.
Or, since you're here, you might as well explore around the code files to find them yourself.
Simple! ^v^
